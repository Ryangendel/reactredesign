I started learning by taking classes on Lynda and Udemy to prepare as much as I could for the program at Northwestern University. During my time there we learned everything from HTML to MySQL to React. Now I have helped to teach two cohorts of coders from all ranges of abilities at the University of Denver. Currently, I am a helping develop, manage, and teach the inaugural Cyber Security class.  </p></Col>
